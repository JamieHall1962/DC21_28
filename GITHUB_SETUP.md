# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and create a new repository:
   - Repository name: `spx-calendar-trading-system`
   - Description: `Automated SPX Double Calendar Spread Trading System with IBKR API`
   - Make it **Private** (recommended for trading systems)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Copy the repository URL** from GitHub (it will look like):
   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spx-calendar-trading-system.git
   ```

3. **Run these commands** in your terminal (replace with your actual GitHub URL):
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spx-calendar-trading-system.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Alternative: Use GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)

```bash
gh repo create spx-calendar-trading-system --private --description "Automated SPX Double Calendar Spread Trading System with IBKR API"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spx-calendar-trading-system.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## What's Already Done

✅ Git repository initialized
✅ All files staged and committed
✅ .gitignore configured to exclude logs, databases, and sensitive data
✅ Comprehensive initial commit message

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup

1. **Clone on other machines**: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spx-calendar-trading-system.git`
2. **Regular backups**: `git add . && git commit -m "Update" && git push`
3. **Branch for experiments**: `git checkout -b feature/new-strategy`

## Security Notes

- Database files (*.db) are excluded from version control
- Log files (*.log) are excluded from version control  
- Consider excluding `spx_calendar_config.py` if it contains sensitive API keys
- The repository should be **PRIVATE** to protect your trading logic
