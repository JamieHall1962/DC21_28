# Exit Process Fixes - Complete Walkthrough

## üîç The Complete Exit Process

### **Scheduled at 3:00 PM Daily**
1. `daily_exit_check()` runs (scheduled M-F at 15:00 ET)
2. Checks all ACTIVE trades for exit criteria (day >= 14)
3. For each trade meeting criteria: calls `close_calendar_position()`

### **Close Process Steps**
1. **Cancel GTC Order** (if exists and not filled)
   - 3 retry attempts, 20 seconds each
   - Triple verification after each attempt
   - **ABORTS close if cancellation fails** (prevents double positions)
   
2. **Get Market Value**
   - Requests current spread price for all 4 legs
   - Uses this as starting close price
   
3. **Get Contract Details**
   - Resolves conId for all 4 option contracts
   - 30 second timeout per contract
   
4. **Place Closing Order**
   - Creates BAG order (all 4 legs together)
   - BUY action with NEGATIVE price (IBKR's debit spread logic)
   - Starts at mid price
   
5. **Wait for Fill**
   - **Timeout: 120 seconds** (2x normal, was 60s)
   - Polls order status every second
   
6. **Retry if Not Filled**
   - Cancels unfilled order
   - Adjusts price:
     - Attempts 1-2: -$0.05 per attempt
     - Attempts 3+: -$0.10 per attempt (more aggressive)
   - Repeats up to 5 times total

## ‚ùå Problems Found & Fixed

### **1. Silent Failures**
**Before:** If close failed, returned False with no alerts
**Now:** Sends SMS immediately with specific reason:
```
üö® CRITICAL: Failed to close [trade] after 5 attempts. 
Position remains OPEN. Final price: $XX.XX. 
MANUAL CLOSE REQUIRED!
```

### **2. No Detailed Error Logging**
**Before:** Just logged "close failed"
**Now:** Logs:
- Exact price range attempted
- Number of attempts
- Final attempt price
- Exception stack traces
- Writes to both main log AND database action log

### **3. Timeout Too Short**
**Before:** 60 seconds to get fill
**Now:** 120 seconds (2x) - closes are critical, need more time

### **4. Not Aggressive Enough**
**Before:** 5 attempts, $0.05 increments = max $0.25 worse than mid
**Now:** 
- Attempts 1-2: $0.05 increments
- Attempts 3-5: $0.10 increments
- Total range: up to $0.35 worse than mid

### **5. Exception Handling**
**Before:** Generic exception catch
**Now:** 
- Full stack trace logging
- SMS alert with exception details
- Database logging of exception
- Position status preserved

### **6. Daily Exit Check**
**Before:** If close failed, just logged it
**Now:**
- Logs critical error
- Already got SMS from close function with details
- Continues checking other trades

## üí™ Why This Won't Happen Again

1. **Bulletproof GTC cancellation** - Won't proceed unless 100% confirmed
2. **Longer timeouts** - 120 seconds gives more time for fills
3. **Aggressive pricing** - Doubles increments after attempt 2
4. **Immediate SMS alerts** - You know within seconds if something fails
5. **Detailed logging** - Can diagnose any failure post-mortem
6. **No silent failures** - Every failure triggers alerts

---

## üéØ What To Do If You Get An Alert

### **"Failed to close after 5 attempts"**
1. Open TWS
2. Find the position (check strikes/expiries in SMS)
3. Manually close the BAG order
4. In web dashboard: click "Stop Managing" and record the closing price

### **"GTC cancellation failed"**
1. Open TWS
2. Find the GTC order (order ID in SMS)
3. Manually cancel it in TWS
4. Then try closing the position again from dashboard

## üìù Testing Recommendation

The next time the system attempts a 3PM exit, monitor your SMS/logs closely. You should see:
- Detailed step-by-step logging
- If anything fails, immediate SMS with specifics
- Position either closes successfully OR you get clear instructions

**No more silent failures. No more babysitting.**
